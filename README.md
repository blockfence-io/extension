# Blockfence Browser Extension

Blockfence is an open-source browser extension. When interacting with any smart contract using Metamask wallet, the Blockfence Extension is activated and provides an explanation in plain English of the smart contract's code. This explanation is generated by ChatGPT after thoroughly analyzing the code. This means that users no longer need to be Solidity developers to understand what they are about to confirm and risk their crypto assets.

This Chrome extension allows users to decode and understand a blockchain smart contract.

The extension is automatically triggered on each transaction and shows a popup with a detailed description of the transaction's contract.

Additionally, you can manually query our platform by cliking on the extension icon.

You can get the official extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)

## Developers Mode
